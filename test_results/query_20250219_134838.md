# Query Results

## Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(TOTALBUDGET) FROM proj_dashboard WHERE DISTRICT = 'Lilongwe';
```

## Results
```
[(None,)]
```

## Answer
Based on the provided SQL query result, it appears that the total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District is not available.

The query result, [(None,)], indicates that there are no records or data available to calculate the total budget for the specified district. This could be due to several reasons, such as:

* No projects have been initiated or completed in Lilongwe District.
* The data for the projects in Lilongwe District is not available or has not been updated in the proj_dashboard table.
* The DISTRICT column in the proj_dashboard table does not contain the correct or expected values for Lilongwe District.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to:

* Verify the data in the proj_dashboard table to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.
* Check the DISTRICT column to confirm that it contains the correct values for Lilongwe District.
* Consult with the data administrators or project managers to determine the cause of the issue and obtain the necessary information to calculate the total budget for the district.
