Test run on: Thu Mar  6 13:42:48 SAST 2025

## Test Summary

### Overall Statistics
- Total Tests: 26
- Passed Tests: 13
- Failed Tests: 13
- Pass Rate: 50%

### UI Tile Tests Analysis
The first three UI tile tests (UI01-UI03) are designed to test the chatbot's ability to handle general queries about all projects.

#### UI01: "Show me all projects"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: I couldn't understand your query. Please try asking about projects in a specific district, sector, or ask about a specific project.
- Status: FAIL

#### UI02: "What projects are available?"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: No matching projects found. Please try different search terms.
- Status: FAIL

#### UI03: "List all projects"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: I couldn't understand your query. Please try asking about projects in a specific district, sector, or ask about a specific project.
- Status: FAIL

### Failed Tests Analysis

The following queries failed to return the expected results:

#### UI01: "Show me all projects"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: I couldn't understand your query. Please try asking about projects in a specific district, sector, or ask about a specific project.
- Notes: The chatbot is not handling general queries well. It requires specific parameters.

#### UI02: "What projects are available?"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: No matching projects found. Please try different search terms.
- Notes: The chatbot is trying to match the query against district names instead of returning all projects.

#### UI03: "List all projects"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: I couldn't understand your query. Please try asking about projects in a specific district, sector, or ask about a specific project.
- Notes: The chatbot is not handling general queries well. It requires specific parameters.

### Key Findings

1. The chatbot struggles with general queries (UI tile tests)
2. District-specific queries show varying success rates
3. Project-specific queries need improvement in response formatting
4. Combined queries (district + sector) need better handling

### Recommendations

1. Improve handling of general queries without requiring specific parameters
2. Standardize response formats across different query types
3. Enhance error messages to be more helpful
4. Add better support for combined queries
