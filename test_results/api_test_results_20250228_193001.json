It then filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the `project_sector` column is equal to `'Roads and bridges'`. This gives us a new DataFrame containing only the road construction projects.\n\nNext, it calculates the total budget for all road construction projects by summing up the values in the `total_budget` column of the filtered DataFrame.\n\nFinally, it prints out a summary of the road construction projects, including the total number of projects, the total budget, and the number of projects by district. The `:,` format specifier is used to add commas to the total budget value, making it easier to read. \n\nNote that this code assumes that the data is stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single project. If your data is stored in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly. \n\nAlso, please let me know if you want any modifications or changes to this code. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance! \n\nBest regards! \n\n### Additional Information\n\nIf you'd like to get more detailed information about specific projects, such as their names, districts, sectors, statuses, and budgets, you can use the following code:\n\n\n\nThis will print out a table showing the name, district, sector, status, and budget for each road construction project. You can customize this code to display only the columns you're interested in. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance! \n\nBest regards! \n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nYou could use this code to:\n\n* Analyze the distribution of road construction projects across different districts\n* Identify the most expensive road construction projects\n* Determine which districts have the highest number of road construction projects\n* Compare the budgets of road construction projects across different sectors\n\nThese are just a few examples of what you could do with this code.

It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only those projects where the value of `'DISTRICT'` matches the given `district`.\n2. **`summarize_project` function**: This function takes a single project dictionary as input and returns a formatted string summarizing its details.\n3. **`format_currency` function**: This function takes an integer amount as input and returns a string representing the same amount with commas separating thousands.\n4. **Main Script**: The main script first calls `get_projects_by_district` to get the list of education projects in Zomba. Then it iterates over this list, using `summarize_project` to generate a summary string for each project. Finally, it prints out the complete response.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions about this code! \n\nBest regards! \n\nP.S. I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance! \n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nHere are some example use cases for this code:\n\n*   **Filtering Projects by District**: Suppose you want to find all projects in a specific district. You can call `get_projects_by_district` with the desired district name as argument.\n*   **Summarizing Project Details**: If you want to display project details in a human-readable format, you can use the `summarize_project` function.\n*   **Formatting Currency Values**: To display currency values with commas, you can use the `format_currency` function.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the code can be applied in different scenarios.
