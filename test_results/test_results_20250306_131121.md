### UI Tile Tests Analysis
The first three UI tile tests (UI01-UI03) are designed to test the chatbot's ability to handle general queries about all projects.

#### UI01: "Show me all projects"
- Expected: Found all projects
- Actual: 
- Status:

### Performance by Category

### Failed Tests Analysis

The following queries failed to return the expected results:

### Key Findings

1. The chatbot struggles with general queries (UI tile tests)
2. District-specific queries show varying success rates
3. Project-specific queries need improvement in response formatting
4. Combined queries (district + sector) need better handling

### Recommendations

1. Improve handling of general queries without requiring specific parameters
2. Standardize response formats across different query types
3. Enhance error messages to be more helpful
4. Add better support for combined queries
