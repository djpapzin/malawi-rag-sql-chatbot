# Query Results

## Query
```sql
SELECT SUM(TOTALBUDGET) FROM proj_dashboard WHERE DISTRICT = 'Lilongwe';
```

## Results
| Column 0 |
| --- |
| N/A |


## Answer
Based on the provided SQL query result, it appears that the information on the total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District is not available.

The query result [(None,)] indicates that there are NULL values in the database, which means that the data for the total budget in Lilongwe District is missing or not recorded.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District.

Possible reasons for this issue include:

- Data entry errors or incomplete records
- Lack of data for specific projects or districts
- Database inconsistencies or missing values

To resolve this issue, I recommend verifying the data entry process, checking for any inconsistencies in the database, and ensuring that all necessary data is recorded and up-to-date.
