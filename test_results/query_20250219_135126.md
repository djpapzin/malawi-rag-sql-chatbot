## Answer
Based on the provided SQL query result, it appears that the total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District is not available.

The query result of [(None,)] indicates that there are NULL values in the 'TOTALBUDGET' column for the projects in Lilongwe District. This suggests that the information is not available.

Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District.

Possible reasons for this could be:

- Data entry errors or incomplete information in the database
- Lack of budget allocation or funding for projects in Lilongwe District
- Insufficient data or records for projects in Lilongwe District

To obtain the accurate total budget, I recommend verifying the data in the proj_dashboard table or checking with the relevant authorities for more information.
