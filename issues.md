Hereâ€™s a summary of your current issues based on the work log, formatted as per your requested style:

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Status** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| RAG PDF Chatbot API endpoint not accessible | Despite the service being up, requests to `/api/rag-pdf-chatbot/query` are returning 404 errors. This could be due to FastAPI route registration or deployment issues. | In Progress |
| RAG SQL Chatbot service not responding | The SQL Chatbot service on port 8001 is returning 404 errors on the `/health` and `/chat` endpoints, likely due to incorrect endpoint configuration or service misconfiguration. | In Progress |
| NLP service on port 3000 returning HTML instead of JSON | The NLP service is misconfigured and is returning HTML instead of expected JSON responses, indicating incorrect API routing or server setup. | In Progress |
| Connectivity issues between frontend (port 3000) and backend services | React frontend is unable to communicate with RAG PDF Chatbot, RAG SQL Chatbot, and NLP services, possibly due to CORS, firewall, or misconfigured API endpoints. | In Progress |
| Service misconfiguration for SQL Chatbot (port 8001) | The SQL Chatbot is experiencing misconfigurations, resulting in 404 errors. Endpoint paths might not be aligned between the frontend and backend. | In Progress |
| Testing and deployment challenges with multi-service application | Systematic testing revealed several issues with service communication, missing endpoints, and inconsistent environment setups (Windows vs. Linux CentOS). | In Progress |
| Frontend import references for renamed `RAGChatbot.js` | After renaming `RAGChatbot.js` to `NASPChatbot.js`, the frontend might still have import statements referencing the old name, potentially causing breaking changes. | To Do |

## Solutions and Action Items

### 1. RAG PDF Chatbot API Endpoint (404 Error)
**Solution Steps:**
1. Verify FastAPI route registration:
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/rag-pdf-chatbot/query")
   async def query_endpoint():
       # Your endpoint logic
   ```
2. Check service deployment:
   - Confirm service is running: `systemctl status rag-pdf-service`
   - Verify port mapping in Nginx configuration
3. Test endpoint locally first:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/rag-pdf-chatbot/query
   ```

### 2. RAG SQL Chatbot Service
**Solution Steps:**
1. Debug service configuration:
   - Check service logs: `journalctl -u sql-chatbot-service`
   - Verify correct port binding in FastAPI app
2. Validate endpoint registration:
   ```python
   @app.get("/health")
   async def health_check():
       return {"status": "healthy"}
   ```
3. Test service locally before deployment

### 3. NLP Service Response Format
**Solution Steps:**
1. Update API response headers:
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/nlp")
   async def nlp_endpoint():
       return JSONResponse(
           content={"message": "Your response"},
           headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
       )
   ```
2. Check Nginx configuration for correct proxy headers:
   ```nginx
   location /api/nlp {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       proxy_set_header Content-Type application/json;
   }
   ```

### 4. Frontend-Backend Connectivity
**Solution Steps:**
1. Configure CORS in FastAPI:
   ```python
   from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
   
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],  # Update with specific origins in production
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```
2. Update frontend API calls with correct base URLs
3. Verify firewall rules allow necessary ports

### 5. SQL Chatbot Service Configuration
**Solution Steps:**
1. Update systemd service configuration:
   ```ini
   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/sql_chatbot.py
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/app
   Environment=PORT=8001
   ```
2. Align endpoint paths between frontend and backend
3. Implement proper error handling and logging

### 6. Multi-service Testing Strategy
**Action Items:**
1. Create environment-specific configuration files
2. Implement health check endpoints for all services
3. Set up automated testing pipeline:
   - Unit tests for each service
   - Integration tests for service communication
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

### 7. Frontend Import References
**Solution Steps:**
1. Update import statements:
   ```javascript
   // Update from
   import { RAGChatbot } from './components/RAGChatbot';
   // To
   import { NASPChatbot } from './components/NASPChatbot';
   ```
2. Search and replace all occurrences:
   ```bash
   grep -r "RAGChatbot" ./src
   ```
3. Update any related component references
