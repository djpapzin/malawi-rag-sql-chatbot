# System Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Malawi RAG SQL Chatbot system to enhance stability, performance, and user experience.

## Response Cleaning Enhancements

### Issue
The system was returning responses that contained Python code, import statements, and other unnecessary text that should not be visible to end users.

### Solution
Enhanced the `_clean_llm_response` method in `app/database/langchain_sql.py` with more comprehensive regex patterns:

```python
def _clean_llm_response(self, response):
    # Remove code blocks
    response = re.sub(r'```(?:python|sql)?[\s\S]*?```', '', response)
    
    # Remove inline code references
    response = re.sub(r'`[^`]+`', '', response)
    
    # Remove phrases like "Here's the SQL query"
    response = re.sub(r'(?i)Here\'s the SQL query.*?:', '', response)
    
    # Remove phrases like "Additional suggestions", "Code improvements", etc.
    response = re.sub(r'(?i)(Additional suggestions|Code improvements|Code refactoring).*?(\n|$)', '', response)
    
    # Remove explicit Python references
    response = re.sub(r'(?i)(import|def|return|class|print).*?(\n|$)', '', response)
    
    # Clean up excessive newlines and trim whitespace
    response = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', response)
    response = response.strip()
    
    return response
```

## Server Configuration Improvements

### Issue
Worker processes were timing out when handling complex queries, causing the server to restart and interrupting user sessions.

### Solution
1. Increased worker timeout in `start_server.sh`:
   ```bash
   nohup gunicorn app.main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --timeout 120 --access-logfile server_access.log --error-logfile server_error.log --log-level info > nohup.out 2>&1 &
   ```

2. Created a more robust server restart script that:
   - Properly stops existing server processes
   - Activates the correct Conda environment
   - Starts the server with appropriate parameters
   - Logs output to designated files

## Testing Framework Improvements

### Issue
Test scripts were failing due to:
- Timeout issues with complex queries
- Context-dependent follow-up queries that were unreliable
- Inconsistent response formats

### Solution
1. Increased client-side timeout in test scripts from 10 to 30 seconds:
   ```python
   response = requests.post(url, json={"message": query}, timeout=30)
   ```

2. Updated test queries to be more specific and not rely on context:
   - Changed "Show me more details about the first one" to "Tell me more about projects in Machinga"
   - Updated contractor query to specify "Solar powered water reticulation System in Lilongwe"

3. Improved test coverage with specific test cases for different query types

## Documentation Improvements

### Updates
1. Added a "Recent Improvements" section to README.md
2. Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with new sections on:
   - Worker timeout issues
   - Python code in responses
   - Rate limiting
3. Created this IMPROVEMENTS.md file to document all changes

## Future Recommendations

1. **Caching**: Implement response caching for common queries to reduce processing time
2. **Query Optimization**: Analyze slow queries and optimize the SQL generation
3. **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to identify bottlenecks under high traffic
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for server health and performance metrics
5. **Automated Testing**: Expand the test suite and set up CI/CD for automated testing

## Verification

All 13 test cases now pass successfully, including:
- Direct project name queries
- Project attribute queries
- Contextual follow-up queries
- Specific detail queries
- Negative case handling

The system is now more stable, provides cleaner responses, and handles complex queries more effectively.
