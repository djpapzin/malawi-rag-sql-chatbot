# Database vs API Response Comparison

## Query 1: Total Budget for Infrastructure Projects

| Source | Total Budget | Number of Projects |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Database | MWK 142,925,000.00 | 28 |
| API Response | MWK 142,925,000.00 | N/A |
| Match? | ✅ Yes | N/A |

## Query 2: Projects in Zomba District

| Source | Number of Projects | Sample Project | Budget Range |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Database | 20 | Zomba Hospital Improvement Phase 1 | MWK 646,173.47 to MWK 9,903,826.53 |
| API Response | 1 | Zomba Hospital Improvement Phase 1 | MWK 646,173.47 |
| Match? | ❌ No (API only returns 1 project) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (for the one returned) |

## Query 3: Completed Projects

| Source | Number of Projects | Sample Project | Budget Range |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Database | 49 | Mzuzu School Construction Phase 1 | MWK 597,448.98 to MWK 9,952,551.02 |
| API Response | 1 | Mzuzu School Construction Phase 1 | MWK 597,448.98 |
| Match? | ❌ No (API only returns 1 project) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (for the one returned) |

## Analysis

1. **Total Budget Query**: The API correctly returns the sum of budgets for infrastructure projects.

2. **Zomba District Query**: 
   - The API returns only the first project in Zomba district
   - The database contains 20 projects in Zomba district
   - The API is returning accurate data but incomplete results

3. **Completed Projects Query**:
   - The API returns only the first completed project
   - The database contains 49 completed projects
   - The API is returning accurate data but incomplete results

## SQL Query Correctness

1. **Total Budget Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(budget) AS total_budget 
   FROM proj_dashboard 
   WHERE projectsector = 'Infrastructure';
   ```
   ✅ This query is correct and returns the accurate total.

2. **Zomba District Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       projectname as project_name,
       district,
       projectsector as project_sector,
       projectstatus as project_status,
       budget as total_budget,
       completionpercentage as completion_percentage,
       substr(startdate,1,4) || '-' || substr(startdate,5,2) || '-' || substr(startdate,7,2) as start_date,
       substr(completiondata,1,4) || '-' || substr(completiondata,5,2) || '-' || substr(completiondata,7,2) as completion_date
   FROM proj_dashboard 
   WHERE district = 'Zomba';
   ```
   ✅ The query is correct but the API implementation only returns the first result.

3. **Completed Projects Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       projectname as project_name,
       district,
       projectsector as project_sector,
       projectstatus as project_status,
       budget as total_budget,
       completionpercentage as completion_percentage,
       substr(startdate,1,4) || '-' || substr(startdate,5,2) || '-' || substr(startdate,7,2) as start_date,
       substr(completiondata,1,4) || '-' || substr(completiondata,5,2) || '-' || substr(completiondata,7,2) as completion_date
   FROM proj_dashboard 
   WHERE projectstatus = 'Completed';
   ```
   ✅ The query is correct but the API implementation only returns the first result.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the Result Limiting Issue**: The API is correctly generating SQL queries but only returning the first result for queries that should return multiple rows. This needs to be fixed in the API implementation.

2. **Add Pagination**: For queries that return many results, implement pagination to allow users to navigate through the results.

3. **Add Count Information**: Include the total count of matching records in the API response metadata.

4. **Improve Error Handling**: Ensure the API properly handles the case where no results are found.
