    - [  ] "Which projects are in [district]?"
    - [  ] "Show me all projects in [district] district"
    - [  ] "List projects from [district]"
    - [  ] "What projects exist in [district]?"
    - [  ] "Projects located in [district]"
  - [  ] Test sector queries with variations

- [  ] Create comprehensive test suite
  - [  ] Document all tested variations
  - [  ] Record which variations work/don't work
  - [  ] Create automated tests for common variations
- [  ] Implement feedback loop
  - [  ] Log failed queries for analysis
  - [  ] Track patterns in failed queries

- [  ] Implement graceful handling for database connection issues
- [  ] Add fallback responses when the system cannot understand a query
- [  ] Create user-friendly error messages for API failures
- [  ] Add logging for errors to help with debugging

## 7. Performance optimization
- [  ] Profile application to identify bottlenecks
- [  ] Optimize database queries
- [  ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [  ] Reduce frontend asset sizes
- [  ] Consider pagination for large result sets

## 8. Implement Pagination for Large Result Sets
- [  ] Modify backend to store full result sets in session when queries return many results
- [  ] Update response_generator.py to limit initial display to 10 items
- [  ] Add clear messaging like "Found 219 health projects, showing first 10..."
- [  ] Design and implement "Show more" and "Show all" buttons in the frontend UI
- [  ] Create API endpoint to fetch additional results without re-querying the LLM
- [  ] Ensure pagination buttons appear only when there are more than 10 results
- [  ] Implement frontend JavaScript to handle pagination button clicks
- [  ] Make sure additional results maintain the same formatting with all required fields
- [  ] Add loading indicator for when additional results are being fetched
- [  ] Test pagination with various queries that return large result sets:
    - [  ] Health sector (219+ projects)
    - [  ] Education sector
    - [  ] District-specific queries with many results
- [  ] Verify the formatting of paginated results matches the LLM-formatted results
