## 6. Improve error handling ❌ (Not Completed)
- [  ] Add better error messages for common user errors
- [  ] Implement graceful handling for database connection issues
- [  ] Add fallback responses when the system cannot understand a query
- [  ] Create user-friendly error messages for API failures

## 7. Performance optimization ❌ (Not Completed)
- [  ] Profile application to identify bottlenecks
- [  ] Optimize database queries
- [  ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [  ] Reduce frontend asset sizes
- [  ] Consider pagination for large result sets

## 8. Implement Pagination for Large Result Sets ❌ (Not Completed)
- [  ] Modify backend to store full result sets in session when queries return many results
- [  ] Update response_generator.py to limit initial display to 10 items
- [  ] Add clear messaging like "Found 219 health projects, showing first 10..."
- [  ] Design and implement "Show more" and "Show all" buttons in the frontend UI
- [  ] Create API endpoint to fetch additional results without re-querying the LLM
- [  ] Ensure pagination buttons appear only when there are more than 10 results
- [  ] Implement frontend JavaScript to handle pagination button clicks
- [  ] Make sure additional results maintain the same formatting with all required fields
- [  ] Add loading indicator for when additional results are being fetched
- [  ] Test pagination with various queries that return large result sets:
    - [  ] Health sector (219+ projects)
    - [  ] Education sector
