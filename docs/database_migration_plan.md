# Database Migration Plan: malawi_projects1.db to pmisProjects.db

## Objective
Replace the current database `/home/dj/malawi-rag-sql-chatbot/malawi_projects1.db` with data from the SQL dump file `/home/dj/malawi-rag-sql-chatbot/pmisProjects.sql`, while ensuring the application works correctly with the new database structure.

## Current Status
- ✅ Migration completed successfully
- ✅ The application now uses `malawi_projects1.db` which contains data imported from `pmisProjects.sql`
- ✅ A symbolic link has been created from `malawi_projects1.db` to `pmisProjects.db` for backward compatibility
- ✅ All application functionality has been tested and works correctly with the new database

## Migration Checklist

### 1. Database Path Updates
- [x] Identify all files referencing the current database path
- [x] Update all references to use `malawi_projects1.db` as the primary database file
- [x] Verify no hardcoded paths remain in the codebase

### 2. Update Database Initialization Script
- [x] Created `convert_database.py` to use the SQL dump file instead of generating test data
- [x] Implemented proper error handling for SQL import
- [x] Added validation to check if the import was successful
- [x] Updated schema differences between the test and production databases

### 3. Data Structure Analysis
- [x] Compared schema between current and new database
- [x] Identified differences in table names, column names, and data types
- [x] Updated application queries to work with the new schema
- [x] Verified all queries work with the new database structure

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Created a backup of the current database
2. ✅ Created the conversion script to import from SQL dump
3. ✅ Updated database paths throughout the codebase
4. ✅ Updated query structure where needed
5. ✅ Ran the conversion script to create the new database
6. ✅ Tested the application with the new database

### 5. Testing Plan
- [x] Verified successful database creation from SQL dump
- [x] Tested basic application functionality
- [x] Verified all queries work with the new database structure
- [x] Tested sample queries for each main feature
- [x] Confirmed performance is acceptable with the new database

### 6. Rollback Plan
- [x] Kept backup of original database
- [x] Created symbolic link for backward compatibility
- [x] Documented steps to revert changes if issues occur

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Configuration
- The application is configured to use `malawi_projects1.db` as the primary database file
- A symbolic link is created from `malawi_projects1.db` to `pmisProjects.db` for backward compatibility
- The database contains 1048 real infrastructure projects from Malawi

### SQL Import Implementation
The `convert_database.py` script:
1. Connects to a new SQLite database
2. Reads and parses the `pmisProjects.sql` file
3. Executes the SQL statements to create tables and import data
4. Validates the import was successful
5. Creates a symbolic link for backward compatibility

### Schema Differences
- The new database uses the `proj_dashboard` table structure from the SQL dump
- All application queries have been updated to work with this structure
- The database contains real project data instead of generated test data

## Post-Migration Verification
- ✅ Verified record counts match expected values (1048 projects)
- ✅ Checked application logs for SQL errors (none found)
- ✅ Tested all features that rely on database queries (all working)
- ✅ Verified query performance with larger dataset (acceptable)
