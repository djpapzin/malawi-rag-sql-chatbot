### Query Processing

### Query Type Detection

The system uses a sophisticated detection system to identify query types:

1. **Specific Project Queries**
   - Quoted project names: `"Tell me about 'Nachuma Market Shed phase 3'"`
   - Project codes: `"Show details for project MW-CR-DO"`
   - Unquoted but well-formed names (2+ words): `"What is the status of Chilipa CDSS Girls Hostel"`

2. **General Queries**
   - Location-based: `"Show projects in Mchinji"`
   - Status-based: `"List ongoing projects"`
   - Sector-based: `"Show education projects"`
   - Combined filters: `"Show ongoing education projects in Southern Region"`

### Query Processing Flow

```

### SQL Generation

1. **Specific Project Queries**
```sql
SELECT 
    PROJECTNAME, FISCALYEAR, REGION, DISTRICT,
    TOTALBUDGET, PROJECTSTATUS, PROJECTSECTOR,
    CONTRACTORNAME, SIGNINGDATE, TOTALEXPENDITURETODATE,
    FUNDINGSOURCE, PROJECTCODE, LASTVISIT,
    COMPLETIONPERCENTAGE, PROJECTDESC, TRADITIONALAUTHORITY,
    STAGE, STARTDATE, COMPLETIONESTIDATE
FROM proj_dashboard
WHERE ISLATEST = 1
AND [project_condition]
LIMIT 1
```

2. **General Queries**
```sql
SELECT

    TOTALBUDGET, PROJECTSTATUS, PROJECTSECTOR
FROM proj_dashboard
WHERE ISLATEST = 1
[filter_conditions]
ORDER BY PROJECTNAME ASC
LIMIT 10

   - User: "Show me projects in the south"
   - LLM Clarification: "Did you mean projects in the Southern Region? I'll search for projects in the Southern Region."
   
2. **No Results Found**
   - User: "Show completed projects in Mchinji"
   - LLM Response: "I couldn't find any completed projects in Mchinji district. However, I found 3 ongoing projects. Would you like to see those instead?"

3. **Invalid Project Names**
   - User: "Tell me about 'School Block'"
   - LLM Response: "The term 'School Block' is too general. Could you please provide a more specific project name? For example, 'Mchinji Secondary School Block'."

## Benefits

   - Financial data queries show high consistency across both systems

3. **Search Flexibility**
   - System handles partial matches for project names
   - Location searches work with various region/district combinations
   - Status filters work with multiple status keywords
   - Budget queries properly handle both presence and absence of financial data
