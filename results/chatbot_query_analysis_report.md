*February 18, 2025*

## Quick Summary
We tested how well the Dziwani chatbot answers questions about Malawi's infrastructure projects. We asked it 20 different questions and watched how it performed.

### Quick Stats üìä

| What We Measured | Result |
|-----------------|---------|
| Questions Asked | 20 |
| Response Speed | 2-3 seconds |
| Success Rate | 100% (never fails) |
| Projects in Database | 198 |

## What Works Well üëç

1. **Speed**: The chatbot is quick! It answers most questions in about 2-3 seconds.

2. **Reliability**: It never crashes or fails to respond.

3. **Finding Specific Places**: It's good at finding projects when you ask about specific locations like Zomba or Rumphi.

4. **Finding Exact Projects**: When you ask about a specific project using its exact name in quotes, it usually finds it.

## What Needs Work üëé

1. **Too Many Results**: Often shows all projects instead of just the relevant ones
   - For example, if you ask about "education projects," it shows everything

2. **Project Code Problems**: Has trouble finding projects when you use their code numbers
   - Example: Searching for "MW-CR-DO" doesn't work well

3. **General Questions**: Needs to be better at filtering results for broad questions
   - Like when someone asks "Show me all market projects"

## How Different Types of Questions Perform

| Question Type | Performance | Example | Result Quality |
|--------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Location Questions | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | "Projects in Zomba" | Very Good |
| Exact Project Names | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | "Nachuma Market Shed" | Good |
| Project Codes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | "Project MW-CR-DO" | Needs Work |
| General Questions | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | "Show education projects" | Needs Work |

## Common Questions and Their Results

| Question | How Well It Works | Why? |
|----------|------------------|------|
| "Show me projects in Zomba" | üòä Great | Finds exactly what you need |
| "Tell me about Nachuma Market" | üòä Good | Works with specific names |
| "Show education projects" | üòï Poor | Shows too many results |
| "Find project MW-CR-DO" | üòï Poor | Doesn't handle codes well |

## What We Should Fix First

### Priority List

| When | What to Fix | Why It's Important |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Now | Show fewer, better results | Makes answers more useful |
| Now | Fix project code search | Helps find specific projects |
| Soon | Better filtering | Makes general searches work |
| Later | Natural language understanding | Makes chat more natural |

## Simple Tips for Users

| If You Want To... | Try This | Avoid This |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Find a specific project | Use quotes: "Nachuma Market" | Just typing: Nachuma Market |
| Search in an area | Name the place: "in Zomba" | General: "in Southern Region" |
| Find by project type | Be specific: "primary school in Zomba" | Too broad: "education projects" |
