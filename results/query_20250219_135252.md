## Answer
Based on the provided SQL query result [(None,)], it appears that the total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District is not available.

This could be due to several reasons:

1. The data for Lilongwe District is not present in the proj_dashboard table.
2. The DISTRICT column in the proj_dashboard table does not contain 'Lilongwe' as a valid value.
3. The TOTALBUDGET column in the proj_dashboard table contains NULL values for projects in Lilongwe District.

To obtain the accurate total budget, I recommend verifying the data in the proj_dashboard table, specifically the DISTRICT and TOTALBUDGET columns.
