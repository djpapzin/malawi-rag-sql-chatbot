## Answer
Based on the provided SQL query result, it appears that the information on the total budget for all projects in Lilongwe District is not available.

The query result [(None,)] indicates that there are NULL values for the total budget, which suggests that the data is either missing or not recorded for the specified projects in Lilongwe District.

Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific total budget for the projects in Lilongwe District.

Possible reasons for this issue include:

1. Data entry errors: The total budget might not have been recorded or entered correctly in the database.
2. Missing data: The data for the total budget might be missing from the database, which could be due to various reasons such as data not being collected or not being uploaded to the database.
3. Data quality issues: The data quality might be poor, which could lead to NULL values or incorrect data.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to investigate the data entry process, check for any data quality issues, and ensure that the data is accurately recorded and uploaded to the database.
